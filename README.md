# The CP Project p1.0.0

# Abstract

CP is a project which tries to build an objective programming language. \(But it is still a work
in progress.)

# Status

This is the only and the earliest version of CP - p1.0.0 and it is not completed.

# Contribution

All contributions are welcome, such as opening an issue, starting a discussion and so on. 

Since this project has only one contributor \([user-name-beta](https://github.com/user-name-beta)\) yet, new contributors will be very welcome.

# Installation

# Usage

Use it as a command-line tool. Such as:

`cp version`

and it will print version information. As what we design, this command-line program has a group of sub commands like `version` (just like git).

### Naming conflict
What you should pay attention to is that the name of cp is as same as a coreutil (which used to copy file) in Unix-like systems. This may make the execution of the real cp difficult. We are working on solving this issue.
